# Day 6 of 100
# Most of it was working on code at https://reeborg.ca/

# def my_name():
#     first_name = "Anaka"
#     last_name = "Norfleet"
#     print(first_name + " " + last_name)
#
# my_name()

# For Loop vs While Loop

# for item in item_list:
    # Do this

# for number in range(a, b):
    # print (number)


# a = 6
# while a > 0:
#     a -= 1
#     print(a)

# boolean can be != True or == False or while not <condition>
# Beware of infinite loops, also cannot nest while loops
